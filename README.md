# Inventorify
Inventorify is my submission for a backend software engineering internship at Shopify for summer 2022.

# How to configure a developement environment

## How to look into the database
To simplify configuration during the evaluation of my submission, I decided to use SQLite as a database. This way, you don't have to setup a full DBMS server. If I asked you to use say MariaDB or MSSql, the exact configuration in which you will run my code would be out of my control. Using SQLite, I have full control over the database configuration since all I require on your side is the ability to create and read files.

In case you are not used to SQLite and you want to look into the database during execution of my application, I recommend you install [SQLiteStudio](https://sqlitestudio.pl/).
